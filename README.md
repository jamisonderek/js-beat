js-beat
=======
This is an app I'm playing with to learn more about jQuery, WebRTC, etc.   The basic idea is to use WebRTC to listen to the microphone input and determine the beats per minute.  I'm currently doing all of my testing using Chrome 33, and I'm not focused on other versions of browsers.


USAGE:
Load the page in Chrome 33, allow access to your microphone, clap your hands.  The beats per minute should be detected and everytime you clap the 'BPM' incidator should blink.  When you stop clapping, it should continue blinking at the current rate.
